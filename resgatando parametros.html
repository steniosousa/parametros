    <p>
        A hundred days have made me older
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same
But all the miles that separate
They disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, it's only you and me

The miles just keep rolling
As the people leave their way to say hello
I've heard this life is overrated
But I hope that it gets better as we go

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, girl, it's only you and me

Everything I know, and anywhere I go
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love
And when the last one falls, when it's all said and done
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, girl, it's only you and me.

            I'm not a perfect person
    There's many things I wish I didn't do
    But I continue learning
    I never meant to do those things to you
    And so, I have to say before I go
    That I just want you to know
    I've found a reason for me
    To change who I used to be
    A reason to start over new
    And the reason is you
    I'm sorry that I hurt you
    It's something I must live with everyday
    And all the pain I put you through
    I wish that I could take it all away
    And be the one who catches all your tears
    That's why I need you to hear
    I've found a reason for me
    To change who I used to be
    A reason to start over new
    And the reason is you
    And the reason is you
    And the reason is you
    And the reason is you
    I'm not a perfect person
    I never meant to do those things to you
    And so I have to say before I go
    That I just want you to know
    I've found a reason for me
    To change who I used to be
    A reason to start over new
    And the reason is you
    I've found a reason to show
    A side of me you didn't know
    A reason for all that I do
    And the reason is you
